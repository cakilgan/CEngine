# CEngine Game Project

This project contains a simple 2D game scene developed using the CEngine game engine. CEngine is a custom game engine built with LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) and OpenGL, providing optimized graphics and resource management.

  
## Features

- **Custom Game Engine**: Built from scratch, allowing full control over graphics and resource handling.
- **2D Rendering**: Efficient 2D sprite rendering using batching techniques.
- **Physics Engine**: Integration with JPhysics library for handling object physics.
- **Animation System**: Play character animations depending on actions like jumping, falling, and running. (has many problems)

## Requirements

- **Java**: Java 8 or higher
- **JavaFX** (for console)
- **LWJGL**: Version 3.x or higher
- **OpenGL**: Modern OpenGL context for rendering

## How To Clone and Test
1. Open the project as maven project on your IDE.
2. and run the Starter.java class for testing the engine. If you can open the test game and run it then there should be no problem.

## How to Start
1. create a main class for your game.
2. make it implements CEComponent
3. if you want a logger you can add by implementing HasLogger.

## To-Do

- Add more game scenes.
- Implement sound management.
- Improve physics performance.
- Improve Animation System and fix the delay issue.
